= Deploying a WebSphere Application Using OpenShift Pipelines

== Introduction

OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Every task runs as a pod, and each step runs as a container within that pod. You can use OpenShift pipelines to deploy your WebSphere apps. TA generates a basic pipeline that you can use as a starting point.

== Steps

In this section, we will be walking you through the deployment of an OpenShift Pipeline that we will use to deploy your WebSphere application.

=== Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the necessary repository:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/gskumar1010/TA-klp-demo
----

Then, change directory to the newly cloned repository by running the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd TA-klp-demo
----

=== Create Pipeline Resources

The cluster admin has already installed the OC Pipelines operator. It is time to create our pipeline.

The first thing we need to do is create a project for our pipeline. Run the following command to create the project:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc new-project websphere-pipelines-%username%
----

//Click on `Home` in the side menu and select `Projects`. Click on `Create Project` in the upper right corner. Name the project `websphere-pipeline-%username%`.

//image::./Images/PipelinesCreateProject.png[image]

Now we will create the pipeline resources. The IBM Transformation Advisor automatically generates the necessary yaml definitions for creating an OpenShift Pipeline that can deploy our WebSphere application.

image::./Images/PipelinesGeneratedFiles.png[image]

We need to create each of these resources using the provided yaml definitions.

`00-apply-manifest-task.yaml` and `00-update-deployment_task.yaml` are custom tasks used by the pipeline.

Run the following command to create the apply manifest task.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/00-apply-manifest-task.yaml
----

Run the following command to create the update deployment task.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/00-update-deployment_task.yaml
----

`01-pipeline.yaml` is the definition for the pipeline itself. Run the following command to create the pipeline.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/01-pipeline.yaml
----

`pv-claim.yaml` will create the persistent storage that the pipeline uses for persistent storage between tasks. Run the following command to create the storage.
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/02-pv-claim.yaml
----
////
We need to import each of these yaml files into OpenShift using the `+` icon in the upper right hand corner of the OpenShift UI and copying and pasting the contents of each file into the UI.

image::./Images/ImportYaml.png[image]

`00-apply-manifest-task.yaml` and `00-update-deployment_task.yaml` are custom tasks used by the pipeline.
Click on + , copy the YAML file and click on Create

```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: apply-manifests
spec:
  params:
  - name: manifest_dir
    description: The directory in source that contains yaml manifests
    type: string
  workspaces:
  - name: source
  steps:
  - name: apply
    image: quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
    workingDir: $(workspaces.source.path)
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
    args:
    - |-
      echo Applying manifests in $(params.manifest_dir) directory
      oc apply -f $(params.manifest_dir)
      echo -----------------------------------
```

Click on + , copy the YAML file and click on Create
```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: update-deployment
spec:
  params:
  - name: deployment
    description: The name of the deployment patch the image
    type: string
  - name: image-url
    description: The url of the image to patch
    type: string
  steps:
  - name: patch
    image: quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
    args:
    - |-
      oc patch deployment $(params.deployment) --patch='{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{
        "containers":[{
          "name": "$(params.deployment)",
          "image":"$(params.image-url)"
        }]
      }}}}'
```

`01-pipeline.yaml` is the definition for the pipeline itself.
Click on + , copy the YAML file and click on Create

```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: build-and-deploy
spec:
  params:
  - name: repo-url
    type: string
    description: The git repository URL to clone from.
  - name: branch-name
    type: string
    description: The git branch to clone.
    default: master
  - name: repo-context
    type: string
    description: The subfolder of the repo containing the dockerfile.
    default: .
  - name: repo-dockerfile
    type: string
    description: The name of the dockerfile to use.
    default: Dockerfile
  - name: image-url
    type: string
    description: The image to push to the registry.
  workspaces:

      value: $(params.image-url)
    - name: DOCKERFILE
      value: $(params.repo-dockerfile)
    - name: CONTEXT
      value: $(params.repo-context)
    - name: TLSVERIFY
      value: "false"
    workspaces:

    taskRef:
      name: apply-manifests
    runAfter:
      - build-application
    params:

    - name: image-url
      value: $(params.image-url)
    runAfter:
    - apply-application-manifests
```

`pv-claim.yaml` will create the persistent storage that the pipeline uses for persistent storage between tasks.
Click on + , copy the YAML file and click on Create

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-task-storage
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
```
////

=== Run the Pipeline

With all of our resources in place, we are ready to run our pipeline!

Importing `03-pipeline-run.yaml` will cause the pipeline to run and build our application.

In the OpenShift web UI, click on the `+` in the upper right hand corner to import our yaml. Copy and paste the yaml below and then click `Create`.

////
Before importing the pipeline definition, we need to update the image-url so that it uses our project.

Run the following command to begin editing the yaml file:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vi pipeline/openshift/03-pipeline-run.yaml
----

Press `i` to enter insert mode. In the last line of the file, replace the current value of `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/myproject/defaultapplication:latest` with the following value:
```
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/websphere-pipeline-%username%/websphere-pipeline:latest
```

After you have made your change, press `esc` and enter `:wq` to save and exit.

Run the following command to build the application:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f pipeline/openshift/03-pipeline-run.yaml
----
////
```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: using-build-and-deploy-
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: build-and-deploy
  workspaces:
  - name: build-workspace
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: shared-task-storage
  params:
  - name: repo-url
    value: https://github.com/gskumar1010/TA-klp-demo.git
  - name: branch-name
    value: master
  - name: repo-dockerfile
    value: Dockerfile
  - name: image-url
    value: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/websphere-pipeline-%username%/websphere-pipeline:latest
```

The process will take a couple of minutes. You can view the pipeline's status in the UI.

image::./Images/PipelinesRunning.png[image]

The pipeline will clone the application's repo, build the application, apply manifests, and update the image.

To see more detailed information about what's going on, select the `Logs` tab.

image::./Images/PipelinesRunningLogs.png[image]

After a few minutes the pipeline run will complete and our application will be deployed.

image::./Images/PipelinesRunCompleted.png[image]

=== Access and Test the Application

Once the deployment is complete, we can access the application by using its route.

On the side menu, click on `Networking` and select `Routes`. You should see the route for the application that we just deployed. Under `Location`, you will see the application's URL.

image::./Images/PipelinesRoutes.png[image]

Take the URL and add `/hitcount` to the end of it so that we hit our Hit Count application's end point. Paste this into your browser to access the application.

For example `http://defaultapplication-websphere-pipelines.apps.ocp.shadowman.dev/hitcount`
NOTE: Make sure you are using `http` instead of `https`.

Select `Enterprise Java Bean (CMP)` as the method of execution, `Global Namespace` as the lookup method, and `Commit` as the transaction type. Click `Increment`.

image::./Images/HitCountApplication03.png[image]

You will see a message indicating that the count has been incremented.
